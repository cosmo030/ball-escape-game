**Ball Escape** is an addictive, browser-based physics arcade game built with HTML5 Canvas and vanilla JavaScript. Guide a bouncing ball through rotating concentric circles, timing your jumps perfectly to escape through the gaps.

## 🎮 How to Play

The goal is simple: **Escape the rings with the fewest clicks possible.**

1.  **Start:** Click anywhere on the screen to begin.
2.  **Move:** The ball bounces automatically. Click to "Kick" (jump) the ball upwards.
3.  **Escape:** Pass through the gaps in the rotating rings to break them.
4.  **Don't Stop:** If the ball stops moving for too long, you lose!
5.  **Win:** Break all the rings to escape.

> **Pro Tip:** This is a "Golf-style" game. A lower score (fewer clicks) is better!

## ✨ Features

* **Physics Engine:** Custom-built physics with gravity, friction, and realistic collision constraints.
* **Procedural Difficulty:** Rings get faster and gaps get larger as you progress outward.
* **"Juicy" Game Feel:**
    * Screen shake on impact.
    * Particle explosions when rings shatter.
    * Dynamic color changes.
* **Audio System:** Synthesized sound effects (no external assets required) using the Web Audio API.
* **Local High Score:** Saves your best "efficiency run" (lowest clicks) to your browser's local storage.
* **Responsive:** Works on desktop and mobile browsers.
